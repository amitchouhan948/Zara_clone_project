# Individual Project At Masai School “Zara Clone”.

Before I start my blog writing on the clone of the website, I want to thank Masai School for this great opportunity and for providing this great platform to enhance my coding and life skills. We have tried our level best to make use of our so far journey and the knowledge that we have gained so far at Masai School to come up with our project.

## Project Details

I have made this website in 5 days in construct week in masai school. this is a E-Commerce website for diffrent type of products of men, women, girls, and boys which have following catagory of products like shoes, bags, hanky ,belts etc.

### Tech Stack

React, json-server, Chakra-ui , React-Router-Dom, API(Heroku deployed)

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
